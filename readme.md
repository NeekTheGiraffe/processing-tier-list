# TierList Maker

## About
I made this program when I wanted to make tier lists with my friends ranking various categories of items.

## Usage
1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download). I used version 3.5.4. As of 4.0 beta 5, 4.0 works, but it has weird scaling issues.
2. Find wherever your Processing programs are located. Mine are located in `Documents/Processing`.
3. In aforementioned directory, add a new directory with the contents of this repository.
4. In Processing, go to `File -> Open`, and click on the directory you created.
5. In the `TierListMaker` file, change `String path = ...;` to whatever path you would like on your machine, that contains only images.
6. Click Run!
